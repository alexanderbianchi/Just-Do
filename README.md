# Just-Do 

- I don't like most to-do apps, so I built this one for myself.
- It's a bit of a stereotypical "Look I built a REST API" project, but to me it's also something I use and want to improve on. And I learned a lot along the way.

## Technologys

- REST API in Express.JS and Node.JS
- Postgres SQL database
- React.JS Frontend
- Bootstrap CSS

## Features

- Sorting of to-do list by date,category,priority,or day of the week.
- Editing and deletion of tasks.
- Encrypted user authentication system
